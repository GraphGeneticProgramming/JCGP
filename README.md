This is the Java implementation of standard Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) by Björn Piepenbrink.

Björn wrote his Bachelor thesis at the Chair XI (Algorithm Engineering) of the Computer Science Department of the TU Dortmund University in 2018. I supervised his thesis and he kindly gave me permission to maintain and extend his CGP source code and his thesis on GitHub. 

The thesis and his disputation slides are in German.

CGP is a highly efficient and flexible form of Genetic Programming that encodes a directed acyclic graph representation of a computer program.
